# object-oriented-project
Store simulation utilizing OO principles, completed in CS class in collaboration with 2 partners. All code is original and written by myself and partners (or denoted what resources were utilized to write code segments). This is done in Java, the purpose of the program is to run a text-based simulation of a store opening, employees stocking/ordering games and products, and customers randomly being generated to make decisions and purchase randomly in the store. Some OO structures/patterns employed were Strategy, Singleton, Command pattern, and Decorators, with superclass constructors and multiple layers of inheritance.
